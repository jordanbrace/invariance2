The primary function of this package is the invarianceSeries() function, which conducts a logicially ordered series of statistical tests that is relevant to my research. These tests are called tests of measurement invariance, which involve using multiple group SEM to evaluate whether psychological instruments are biased between groups. This involves fitting multiple group SEM models with between-group parameter constraints. There are different levels of invariance, defined by the number of parameters constrained to equality. Invariance is tested by evaluating the change in fit from one invariance level to the next, starting at a level with no equality constraints, and model fit is simply the sum of chi-squares when fitting a single group model to each group separately. Higher levels of invariance are nested within lower levels, meaning the set of all possible solutions to the fit of a higher level of invariance is a subset of any lower level of invariance.

```{r}
data<-read.csv("https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11692532/la05noninvcovs2k15n110data1.csv", header=T)
```
This data set contains 8 continuous variables plus a grouping variable with two levels. There are 110 observations in each group.

We will fit the following confirmatory factor analytic (CFA) model:
```{r}
ana.model<-"
f1=~y1+y2+y3+y4
f2=~y5+y6+y7+y8
"
```
The proposed model states that variables 1-4 load on factor 1, and variables 5-8 load on latent variable 2. No crossloadings or correlated residuals are specified, and latent variables are free to covary.

Testing measurement invariance involves first specifying models for each level of invariance, and then comparing the change in fit.

The first level is specified as follows:
```{r}
m0<-cfa(ana.model,data=data,group="group",estimator="mlm",mimic="EQS")
m0
```
The "group" argument is the name of the grouping variable in data. The estimator="mlm" argument tells lavaan to include the Satorra-Bentler scaled chi-square in the SEM output, and the mimic="EQS" argument makes lavaan mimic how commercial the SEM software package EQS estimates model fit.

The second invariance model introduces between group equality constraints on factor loadings. Instead of writing a new analysis model including these constraints, we can add equality constraints in the cfa function.
```{r}
m1<-cfa(ana.model,data=data,group="group",estimator="mlm",mimic="EQS",group.equal=c("loadings"))
m1
```

We can evaluate this difference one of two ways:

1) Using the unscaled difference statistic, D, included in this package

```{r}
Dnorm(m0,m1)
```
chidiff is just the difference in ML chi-squares between the two models. df is the difference in degrees of freedom. This chi-square is tested against this many degrees of freedom.

Alternatively, we can use the scaled chi-square difference test, DSB, which is robust to nonnormal data.
```{r}
sapply(data[,2:9],kurtosi)
```
Kurtosis is very high in this dataset, so it is appropriate to use a scaled fit statistic.

```{r}
DSB(m0,m1)
```
Output for the scaled statistic includes the unscaled statistic.

The full invariance series involves six model fits and five difference tests, which is time consuming if we have to run all of them. The function invarianceSeries() conducts all five difference tests.

```{r}
invarianceSeries(ana.model,data,group="group")
```
As can be seen from this output, failure to correct for non-normality results in rejection of the third invariance model, which involves introducing residual variance constraints on top of loading and intercept constraints. When the difference test corrects for non-normality, invariance is rejected at the fifth stage, where latent mean constraints are introduced on top of existing loading, intercept, residual variance, and latent variance/covariance cosntraints.
